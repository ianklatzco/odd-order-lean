# Minimal normal subgroups and elementary abelian groups

A *minimal normal subgroup* of a group `G` is a nontrivial normal subgroup that
contains no nontrivial normal subgroup of `G` other than itself. A group is
*elementary abelian* for a prime `p` if it is commutative and every element `g`
satisfies `g ^ p = 1`.

The main result of this file is the first step in the chief-series analysis of
finite solvable groups: every minimal normal subgroup of a finite solvable
group is elementary abelian for some prime `p`.

## Main definitions

* `IsElementaryAbelian p G`: `G` is commutative and every element satisfies `g ^ p = 1`.
* `Subgroup.IsMinNormal N`: `N` is a minimal normal subgroup of `G`.

## Main results

* `Subgroup.exists_isMinNormal`: every nontrivial finite group has a minimal
  normal subgroup.
* `Subgroup.IsMinNormal.isElementaryAbelian`: every minimal normal subgroup of
  a finite solvable group is elementary abelian for some prime `p`.

These correspond to MathComp's `minnormal`, `p.-abelem` and
`minnormal_solvable_abelem` (`minnormal_solvable`).

/-- A group `G` is *elementary abelian* for `p` if it is commutative and every
element `g` satisfies `g ^ p = 1`.  For a prime `p` these are exactly the
groups expressible as vector spaces over `ZMod p`: the additivization of an
elementary abelian group is a `Module (ZMod p)` via `AddCommGroup.zmodModule`.
(That transport is deliberately not set up here.)

For a subgroup `N : Subgroup G`, apply this to the coercion: `IsElementaryAbelian p N`.

This corresponds to MathComp's `p.-abelem`. -/

minimal among nontrivial normal subgroups of `G`, i.e. an atom in the lattice
of normal subgroups of `G`.

abelian**: if `N` is a minimal normal subgroup of a finite solvable group `G`,
then there is a prime `p` such that `N` is commutative and every element of
`N` satisfies `g ^ p = 1`.
